# Snake Game in C++
Welcome to the classic Snake Game implementation in C++! This simple console-based game allows players to control a snake, collect food, and grow longer, all while aiming for the highest score without colliding with the snake’s tail.

## Rules of the Game
- ** Don’t  bite your own tail. Crashing into your tail will end the game immediately.
- ** Eating the food (o) earns you 1 points.
- ** The player’s total score is calculated based on the number of fruits the snake consumes.
- ** The length of the snake increases after eating the fruits.
- ** Use w/↑/W, a/←/A, s/↓/S, and d/→/D keys to move the snake.
